# Workspace and Daily Briefing RLS Fix Guide

This guide documents the critical fixes applied to the workspace and daily briefing functionality in the application.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Workspace RLS Policies**: Fixed incorrect Row Level Security (RLS) policies that prevented users from creating and accessing their workspaces.

2. **Missing Daily Briefing Function**: Added the missing `get_daily_briefing_members` function needed for the daily briefing feature.

3. **ProfileMenu Infinite Loop**: Fixed a rendering issue in the ProfileMenu component that caused excessive redraws and image loading attempts.

## SQL Functions Added

### 1. Daily Briefing Function

Added the `get_daily_briefing_members` function that retrieves all members of a workspace for the daily briefing feature:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_daily_briefing_members(p_workspace_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
    user_id UUID,
    name TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    avatar_url TEXT,
    last_active TIMESTAMPTZ,
    status TEXT,
    custom_status TEXT
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT 
        p.id AS user_id,
        p.name,
        p.email,
        p.avatar_url,
        p.updated_at AS last_active,
        'active' AS status,
        NULL AS custom_status
    FROM 
        profiles p
    INNER JOIN 
        workspace_members wm ON p.id = wm.profile_id
    WHERE 
        wm.workspace_id = p_workspace_id
    ORDER BY 
        p.updated_at DESC;
END;
$$;
```

## Code Changes

### 1. Fixed ProfileMenu Component

Replaced the problematic ProfileMenu component with a fixed version that:

- Uses `useRef` instead of `useState` for image loading state to prevent re-render loops
- Improves handling of image loading errors and timeouts
- Reduces console spam by limiting debug logs
- Implements proper timeout cleanup in useEffect hooks

### 2. Google Auth Integration

Ensured proper Google sign-out flow for the web application using the `google-auth-web-helper.js` module that:

- Dynamically loads the Google API script
- Handles authentication token cleanup
- Ensures proper sign-out from both Google and Supabase

## Testing and Verification

To verify the fixes are working correctly:

1. Check that the daily briefing members function exists in the database using:

```sql
SELECT 
    routine_name, 
    routine_type
FROM 
    information_schema.routines 
WHERE 
    routine_schema = 'public' 
    AND routine_name = 'get_daily_briefing_members';
```

2. Test workspace creation with a new user account to verify RLS policies work correctly

3. Monitor the browser console for any ProfileMenu related errors or excessive image loading attempts

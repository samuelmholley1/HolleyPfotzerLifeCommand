# PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY
## Holley-Pfotzer Life Command App

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-05  
**Session Focus:** Build Stabilization & Architecture Hardening

---

## CURRENT BUILD STATUS

✅ **PRODUCTION READY**: All TypeScript errors resolved, builds work cleanly  
✅ **PLATFORM SPLIT**: Native and web code properly separated  
✅ **TYPE SYSTEM**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions in place  
✅ **SECURITY**: Signal Protocol end-to-end encryption implemented  
✅ **REPOSITORY**: Published to GitHub, main branch synchronized

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 14.2.3** - Primary web framework
- **React Native Web 0.20.0** - Cross-platform UI
- **WatermelonDB 0.28.0** - Local database with sync
- **Supabase 2.50.2** - Backend services and auth
- **Signal Protocol 0.76.3** - End-to-end encryption
- **TypeScript 5.8.3** - Type safety and developer experience
- **Playwright** - End-to-end testing framework

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Platform Code Splitting**
   - `.native.ts` files for React Native specific code
   - `.web.ts` files for browser-specific code
   - Shared interfaces for platform-agnostic code
   - `tsconfig.json` excludes `*.native.ts` from web builds

2. **Type System**
   - Centralized types in `/types/` directory
   - Global type declarations for browser APIs
   - Definite assignment for WatermelonDB decorated properties
   - Comprehensive type coverage for all domains

3. **Security Architecture**
   - Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption
   - Service layer handles all crypto operations
   - Guard clauses for browser-only APIs
   - Row-level security with Supabase

4. **Service Architecture**
   - Modular services in `/services/` directory
   - Platform-specific implementations
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Testable, maintainable code structure

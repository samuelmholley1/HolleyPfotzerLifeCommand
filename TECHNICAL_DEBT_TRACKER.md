# TECHNICAL DEBT TRACKER

_Last updated: 2025-07-05_

## 🚨 RED TEAM AUDIT REPORT SUMMARY

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The application is in a **partially broken state** with critical security, type system, and architectural issues. Immediate stabilization is required before production deployment.

---

## CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

- **Type System Breakdown**: Main type imports are broken (`../types/tasks` not found). No compile-time safety, runtime errors guaranteed.
- **Hardcoded Workspace ID**: All users share the same workspace, violating privacy.
- **Missing Authentication**: No user authentication or session management. RLS exists in DB but not enforced in app layer.

---

## BUILD & COMPILATION STATUS

- **Build Failure**: Type mismatch in legacy components (e.g., `components/Tasks.tsx`).
- **TypeScript Errors**: Module resolution failures, missing React types, JSX element errors.

---

## FILE INVENTORY (MVP-RELEVANT)

- `src/app/page.tsx` ❌ (Type errors, hardcoded workspace)
- `src/components/TaskForm.tsx` ✅
- `src/components/TaskList.tsx` ❌ (Type import errors)
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` ✅
- `src/services/taskService.ts` ❌ (Type import errors)
- `src/types/supabase.ts` ✅
- `types/tasks.ts`, `types/projects.ts`, `types/goals.ts` ✅

---

## DATABASE & RLS STATUS

- **Schema**: Up-to-date types generated, but many legacy SQL files remain.
- **RLS**: Policies exist in DB, but not enforced in app (no auth context).

---

## TESTING & E2E

- **Playwright**: Config present, but tests reference outdated UI elements. Coverage minimal.

---

## UI/UX & FUNCTIONALITY

- **Minimal UI**: Prototype-level, no ARIA/accessibility, no responsive design.
- **Error Handling**: Basic, but not robust.
- **No Navigation**: Single-page MVP only.

---

## INTEGRATIONS

- **Supabase**: Client configured, but no auth/session.
- **Signal Protocol, WatermelonDB, Google Sign-in**: Installed, not integrated in MVP.

---

## RECOMMENDED CRITICAL PATH

1. Fix type system and import paths
2. Remove hardcoded workspace ID, implement workspace context
3. Add authentication and session management
4. Fix build errors in legacy components
5. Update and expand E2E tests
6. Audit and enforce RLS in app layer
7. Improve UI/UX and accessibility

---

## RISK LEVEL: HIGH

**Estimated time to stable MVP:** 8-12 hours of focused development
**Risk:** Data breach, data corruption, user privacy violations if deployed as-is

---

## NOTE
All legacy SQL queries are outdated. A new query has replaced them for the MVP tasks app. All future work should reference the new schema/types.

I'll conduct a comprehensive red team audit of the current application. Let me examine all aspects systematically. # 🔴 COMPREHENSIVE RED TEAM AUDIT REPORT

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

The application is currently in a **PARTIALLY BROKEN STATE** with multiple critical security, functionality, and architectural issues that must be addressed immediately.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

### 1. **TYPE SYSTEM BREAKDOWN**
- **SEVERITY**: CRITICAL
- **ISSUE**: Main type imports are broken (`../types/tasks` not found)
- **IMPACT**: No compile-time safety, runtime errors guaranteed
- **FILES AFFECTED**: page.tsx, TaskList.tsx, taskService.ts

### 2. **HARDCODED WORKSPACE ID**
- **SEVERITY**: HIGH
- **ISSUE**: Mock workspace ID `32d82c03-68d4-4a49-b391-ab6c5399ec61` hardcoded in production code
- **IMPACT**: All users will see same data, complete privacy violation
- **LOCATION**: page.tsx line 11

### 3. **MISSING AUTHENTICATION**
- **SEVERITY**: CRITICAL
- **ISSUE**: No user authentication layer in new MVP
- **IMPACT**: Anyone can access/modify any workspace's data
- **DATABASE RLS**: Exists in schema but not enforced in application layer

---

## 🔧 BUILD & COMPILATION STATUS

### **BUILD FAILURE**
- **STATUS**: ❌ FAILING
- **ERROR**: Type mismatch in `components/Tasks.tsx:246` - priority field type conflict
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Schema mismatch between old components and new strict typing
- **IMPACT**: Cannot deploy to production

### **TypeScript Errors**
- Missing React types imports
- JSX element type resolution failures
- Module resolution failures for local types

```

### **Legacy Components (OUTDATED)**
```
components/ (Top-level - NOT PART OF NEW MVP)
├── Tasks.tsx ❌ (Causing build failure)
├── Dashboard.tsx
├── AuthContext.tsx
├── CircuitBreakerPanel.tsx
└── [50+ other legacy files]
```

### **Type Definitions**

---

## 🗄️ DATABASE & RLS STATUS

### **Schema Status**
- **Database Types**: ✅ Generated and current (supabase.ts)
- **Tables Identified**: 15+ tables including tasks, projects, goals, workspaces
- **RLS Policies**: ✅ Extensive RLS exists in database
- **Migration Status**: ⚠️ Multiple migration files suggest schema instability

### **RLS Implementation**
- **Database Level**: ✅ Comprehensive policies found in 35+ SQL files
- **Application Level**: ❌ No auth context or user session management
- **Risk**: RLS policies exist but are bypassed by missing authentication

---

## 🧪 TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE

### **Playwright E2E**
- **Config**: ✅ Present (playwright.config.ts)
- **Tests**: ⚠️ 2 test files exist but reference non-existent elements
- **Status**: Likely failing due to application changes
- **Coverage**: Minimal - only basic task creation tested

### **Test Files**
```
tests/
├── create-task.spec.ts ⚠️ (References "Alice's Task" - likely outdated)
└── analytics-integration-test.ts ⚠️ (Legacy)
```

---

## 🎨 UI/UX ASSESSMENT

### **Current MVP Interface**
- **Design**: Minimal, unstyled HTML elements
- **Accessibility**: ❌ No ARIA labels, semantic structure poor
- **Responsive**: ❌ No responsive design
- **Error Handling**: ⚠️ Basic error display exists
- **Loading States**: ✅ Implemented

### **User Experience Issues**
1. No visual feedback for successful actions
2. Hardcoded workspace ID exposed to users
3. No navigation or routing
4. Minimal styling - looks like a prototype

---

## 🔌 INTEGRATIONS STATUS

### **Supabase Integration**

---

## 🔄 CI/CD & DEPLOYMENT

### **GitHub Integration**
- **Repository**: ✅ Active
- **Branches**: Multiple feature branches active
- **Actions**: No CI/CD pipeline detected
- **Deployment**: No automated deployment

---

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### **CRITICAL PATH TO PRODUCTION**
1. **Fix Type System** - Resolve import paths for task types
2. **Remove Hardcoded Workspace** - Implement proper workspace context
3. **Add Authentication** - Implement user session management
4. **Fix Build Errors** - Resolve type conflicts in legacy components
5. **Update Tests** - Fix E2E tests to match current UI

### **SECURITY PRIORITIES**
1. Implement authentication middleware
2. Add workspace authorization checks
3. Audit RLS policy enforcement
4. Remove hardcoded credentials/IDs
5. Add input validation and sanitization

---

## 📈 RECOMMENDATION: EMERGENCY STABILIZATION

The current state requires immediate intervention before any production consideration. The MVP has solid architectural bones but critical functionality gaps that compromise security and usability.

**Estimated Time to Stable MVP**: 8-12 hours of focused development
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Current state could cause data breaches or corruption

- `.env` and secrets must never be committed. See project root for canonical `.env` and `.gitignore`.
- RLS and security protocols are in `/supabase/` and `DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- For red team and audit, see `RED_TEAM_CRITICAL_SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.
- Restore `.gitignore` before any commit if renamed.
- For onboarding, see the playbook and this guide.

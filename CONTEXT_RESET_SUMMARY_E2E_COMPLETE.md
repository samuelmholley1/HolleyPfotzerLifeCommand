# Context Window Reset Summary

## Completed Work
Successfully completed a comprehensive E2E testing stabilization project for the Life Command monorepo. All objectives achieved:

### âœ… Stabilization Complete
- **E2E Environment**: Robust propagation and mocking implemented
- **Authentication Mocking**: Unified MockAuthContext with type safety
- **API Mocking**: Stateful client-side mocking via Playwright `page.route()`
- **Component Integration**: TaskForm and TaskList with robust `data-testid` selectors
- **Type Safety**: Unified AuthUser and workspace context types
- **CI Reliability**: Tests pass consistently in both local and CI environments

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **Client-Side Mocking Strategy**: Replaced server-side mocking with stateful Playwright route interception
2. **Type Unification**: Created unified auth types shared between real and mock contexts
3. **Environment Propagation**: Proper `.env.test` handling and E2E mode detection
4. **Test Isolation**: Each test gets fresh mock state via `beforeEach` hooks
5. **Robust Selectors**: All components use `data-testid` for reliable element selection

### Files Modified/Created
- `packages/web/e2e/auth.spec.ts` - Stabilized auth flow tests
- `packages/web/e2e/create-task.spec.ts` - Task creation E2E tests
- `packages/web/src/contexts/MockAuthContext.tsx` - Unified mock auth provider
- `packages/web/src/types/auth.ts` - Unified auth type definitions
- `packages/web/playwright.config.ts` - Robust test configuration
- `packages/web/.env.test` - E2E environment variables
- Various component files with `data-testid` additions

### Documentation Updates
- Created `packages/web/TESTING.md` with comprehensive testing guidance
- Updated `COMPLETED_STEPS_LOG.md` with E2E stabilization milestone
- Updated `PROJECT_PLAYBOOK.md` to include E2E testing guide reference

## Current State
- All E2E tests pass reliably
- Mock authentication works correctly in E2E mode
- Task creation and listing functionality verified
- CI-ready with proper environment isolation
- TypeScript types unified between real and mock auth
- No pending tasks or blockers

## For Next Agent
The E2E testing infrastructure is now stable and production-ready. Future work can focus on:
- Adding more E2E test scenarios
- Expanding mock API coverage for other entities
- Performance optimization
- Additional accessibility testing

All implementation details, decisions, and troubleshooting context are documented in the E2E Testing Guide and this conversation history.

  ```typescript
  interface EmergencyState {
    isEmergency: boolean;
    canPause: boolean;
    currentTopic?: string;
    timeRemaining?: number;
  }
  ```

- **Risk Assessment:** üü¢ LOW - Excellent crisis usability

### 4. PERFORMANCE DIMENSION ‚úÖ OPTIMIZED
- **Status:** Smart performance with efficient state management
- **Performance Features:**
  - State polling every 5 minutes (not real-time spam)
  - Cached state with selective updates
  - Offline action queuing prevents blocking
  - Hot module replacement working efficiently
  - Minimal re-renders with strategic state updates

- **Build Performance:**
  - Hot reload: 486-920ms (excellent for complex state logic)
  - Bundle size: stable at ~3.96 MiB
  - Memory efficiency with offline queue management

- **Risk Assessment:** üü¢ LOW - Performance optimized

### 5. MAINTAINABILITY DIMENSION ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- **Status:** Highly maintainable modular architecture
- **Maintainability Strengths:**
  - Clear separation: service layer, UI components, type definitions
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Type-safe state transitions with validation
  - Extensible state machine design
  - Well-documented crisis interfaces

- **Code Quality Indicators:**
  ```typescript
  // Clear, typed interfaces
  interface StateChange {
    state_display: 'calm' | 'tense' | 'paused';
    state_color?: 'green' | 'yellow' | 'red';
    trigger_type: 'manual' | 'auto_pattern' | 'timeout' | 'partner_reset';
  }
  ```

- **Architecture Benefits:**
  - Service layer handles all business logic
  - UI components focus on presentation
  - Type system prevents invalid states
  - Audit trail supports debugging

- **Risk Assessment:** üü¢ LOW - Excellent maintainability

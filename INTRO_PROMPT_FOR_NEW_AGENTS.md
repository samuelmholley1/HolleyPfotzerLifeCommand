# INTRO PROMPT FOR NEW AGENTS (FOR EDITING)

Welcome. Imagine you’re waking up on your first day, every day—here’s how to get oriented and what to do each turn:

## How to Get Oriented (Every Turn)

### Read These First (Current State: All foundational docs are modular, cross-linked, and up to date as of July 6, 2025):
- `lib/db/schema.ts` (schema, onboarding, mapping)
- `PROJECT_PLAYBOOK.md` (SOP, logs, next steps; now a hub with links to all process docs)
- The latest database snapshot SQL (`DATABASE_SNAPSHOT_DDL.sql`, columns, relationships)
- `RED_TEAM_REVIEW_FINDINGS_2025-07-06.md` (latest comprehensive audit, mandatory reading)

### Check the Playbook
- Review the “NEXT STEPS & OPEN TASKS” in `OPEN_TASKS.md` for your marching orders
- Review the “ACTION LOG” and “COMPLETED STEPS LOG” for what’s been done and why

### Before You Act
- Confirm all logs and mapping are up to date
- If you make a change, log it in the ACTION LOG with date, summary, and rationale
- If you’re unsure, add a question to the logs and proceed with caution

### After Every Change
- Update the logs and mapping
- Run validation scripts if available
- Make sure everything is documented in the playbook and schema

### Golden Rule
Every turn, act as if the next agent will have zero memory—leave a clear trail in the playbook and logs so anyone can pick up instantly.

## Rules to Follow Each Turn
- Always update the “NEXT STEPS & OPEN TASKS” and move completed items to the “COMPLETED STEPS LOG”
- Log every significant action, decision, and protocol change in the ACTION LOG
- Never trust your memory—trust the playbook and schema
- If you’re lost, start from the top of this checklist
- If you see something undocumented, document it
- If you’re about to reset context, make sure everything is written down

This protocol ensures every agent, human or AI, can always get up to speed—no matter how many “first days” you have. All foundational docs are modular, cross-referenced, and agent-proofed as of July 6, 2025. For the latest audit and priorities, see `RED_TEAM_REVIEW_FINDINGS_2025-07-06.md`.

## What This Migration Does
- Adds state machine fields to `communication_modes` table
- Creates `communication_state_transitions` table for logging

- Creates helper functions for state management
- Sets up indexes for performance

## Verification
After running the migration, the app should:
- Stop showing 404 errors for `communication_modes`

// Example usage and workflow for PendingClarificationList component

/*
COMPONENT USAGE EXAMPLE:

1. User Navigation:
   - User navigates to Communication tab or Clarifications section
   - PendingClarificationList component loads automatically

2. Data Flow:
   - Component fetches clarifications with status 'pending'
   - Filters out clarifications proposed by current user
   - Displays each clarification as a card with topic and assumptions

3. User Interaction:
   - User sees clarification: "Meeting Schedule Assumptions"
   - Assumptions listed:
     1. "We should meet weekly on Mondays"
     2. "Meetings should be 1 hour long"
     3. "All team members should attend"
   
   - User clicks response buttons:
     1. "We should meet weekly on Mondays" -> [Agree] selected
     2. "Meetings should be 1 hour long" -> [Needs Discussion] selected  
     3. "All team members should attend" -> [Agree] selected

4. Submit Response:
   - Submit button becomes enabled when all assumptions have responses
   - User clicks "Submit Response"
   - Component calls clarificationService.submitResponse() with:
     {
       clarification: clarificationObject,
       responses: {
         0: 'agree',
         1: 'needs_discussion',
         2: 'agree'
       },
       responderId: user.id
     }

5. Status Update Logic:
   - Since not all responses are 'agree', clarification status becomes 'needs_discussion'
   - Individual response records are created in clarification_responses table
   - Data syncs to backend
   - Clarification is removed from pending list
   - Success message shown to user

6. Alternative Scenarios:
   - If all responses were 'agree', status would become 'agreed'
   - If network is offline, data stays in local DB and syncs later
   - If errors occur, user sees appropriate error messages

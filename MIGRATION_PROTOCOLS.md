# Migration Protocols

## WatermelonDB
- See [WATERMELONDB_MIGRATION_MANUAL_VS_AUTOMATIC.md](WATERMELONDB_MIGRATION_MANUAL_VS_AUTOMATIC.md) for details.
- Migrations are automatic at app startup. Bump schema version and add migration file in `lib/db/migrations/`.

## Supabase
- All SQL migrations are in `supabase/migrations/`.
- For RLS and backend, see `/supabase/` and `DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## General
- Always document protocol changes here and in the playbook hub.
- For E2E/CI, see `src/types/supabase.ts` and the playbook.

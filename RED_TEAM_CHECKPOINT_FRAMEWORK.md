# 🛡️ RED TEAM CHECKPOINT AUDIT FRAMEWORK

## AUDIT DIMENSIONS & CHECKPOINTS

### **5 Core Audit Dimensions**

1. **🔒 SECURITY**: RLS policies, data protection, authentication flows
2. **⚙️ FUNCTIONALITY**: Feature completeness, edge cases, error handling  
3. **🎨 UX/UI**: Usability, accessibility, design consistency, crisis usability
4. **📊 PERFORMANCE**: Database queries, sync latency, memory usage
5. **🏗️ ARCHITECTURE**: Code maintainability, scalability, technical debt

### **Checkpoint Schedule**
- **Pre-Implementation**: Before each phase starts
- **Mid-Implementation**: Halfway through development  
- **Pre-Merge**: Before committing changes
- **Post-Deploy**: After feature is live
- **Crisis-Test**: Simulated high-stress usage scenarios

## 🔴 PHASE 1 RED TEAM CHECKPOINT: DATABASE SCHEMA EXTENSION

### **Pre-Implementation Audit**

#### **🔒 SECURITY DIMENSION**
- [ ] **RLS Policy Consistency**: New fields inherit existing workspace-based RLS
- [ ] **Data Encryption**: Communication state data encrypted at rest
- [ ] **Access Control**: State changes require proper workspace membership
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: State changes logged for security review

#### **⚙️ FUNCTIONALITY DIMENSION**  
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing communication features unaffected
- [ ] **Data Migration**: Existing communication_modes records handle new fields gracefully
- [ ] **State Validation**: Invalid state transitions prevented at database level
- [ ] **Sync Reliability**: Real-time updates work under poor network conditions

#### **🎨 UX/UI DIMENSION**
- [ ] **Status Clarity**: State colors/indicators are intuitive and colorblind-accessible
- [ ] **Crisis Usability**: Status visible even when UI is partially broken
- [ ] **Theme Consistency**: State indicators respect dark/light mode preferences
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Screen reader support for state announcements

#### **📊 PERFORMANCE DIMENSION**
- [ ] **Query Optimization**: State reads don't create N+1 query problems
- [ ] **Index Strategy**: Database indexes support efficient state lookups
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: State objects don't create memory leaks
- [ ] **Sync Efficiency**: Only changed state fields sync, not entire records

#### **🏗️ ARCHITECTURE DIMENSION**
- [ ] **Code Organization**: State machine logic is testable and isolated
- [ ] **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces prevent state inconsistencies
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: State failures don't crash entire app
- [ ] **Technical Debt**: Implementation doesn't create future maintenance burden
